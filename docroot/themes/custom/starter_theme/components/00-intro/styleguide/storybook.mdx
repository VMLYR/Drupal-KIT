# Storybook

The components (and accompanying documentation) for this theme are built using **Storybook**, <br />
it is based on an implementation done by the Emulsify Drupal theme but you don't need to know about Emulsify to be able to use Storybook. <br />
The main difference is that we use some node modules and setup to be able to use Twig for building components, because Storybook has no built-in Twig support.

The principles of how Storybook works, can be found here:
- https://storybook.js.org/docs
- https://docs.emulsify.info/usage/writing-stories

Under each category (atoms, molecules, …) you will find specific examples, with documentation, of how to build those types of components.<br />
Other than that, some existing components also contain documentation on how to use or change them (if needed).

## Commands

Storybook runs on webpack and npm. In order to build the styleguide, you need to have installed the packages:<br />
`npm install`<br />
And then run one of the storybook commands (found in package.json):
- "storybook": runs in watch-mode and gives you a url to surf to on localhost
- "build-storybook": builds an actual folder with the styleguide in it, so you can put it on a remote server to share with others

## Storybook configuration

You will find a `.storybook` folder in side your theme, which contains all manner of setup.<br/>
If you need to add something extra, it will probably be in the `preview.js`-file<br/>

### importing assets

The main thing you need to know, is that this is the place where you need to import JS and CSS/SASS that needs to be available for ALL components.<br/>
So any styling or Js inherited from Drupal core, a parent theme or a Drupal module, should be loaded here. <br />
That includes libraries you explicitely load in your theme.info file<br/>
Just see the examples and comments already in `preview.js` to see how it is done.

For example, this loads some CSS from stable that is inherited in our Drupal theme. Notice that the path is relative to the `.storybook` folder:<br />
`import '../../../../core/themes/stable/css/user/user.module.css';`

If your JS has an equivalent node-module, however, you could install it using npm (add it to package.json using --save-dev) and import it directly.<br />
An example of this, is how we added jquery-ui in `preview.js`.

However, some 3rd party libraries can't be imported directly (eg. AMD modules like jQuery).<br />
The solution consists of 2 parts:
- add a new global variable in `main.js` (see the `jQuery` example in there)
- add a js-file that imports the library and sets up that same global (see `.storybook/jquery-global.js`)

You can find info on how that works over here:
- https://docs.emulsify.info/help/3rd-party-libraries
- https://github.com/emulsify-ds/emulsify-drupal/issues/62

Besides importing global assets, you can also import them into specific components using its `x.stories.js` file. <br />
Info on that can be found in the example components in atoms, molecules, organisms, …

### adding aliases

The normal aliases (as defined in your theme info.yml) have also been added to Storybook, in the top of the `.storybook/webpack.config.js` file.<br />
If you need to add more, please do so in both places as well.

## Storybook components

The storybook component files should always be wrapped in a `styleguide` folder, in order to differentiate between the dummy Storybook component and the templates used by Drupal directly.

You need at least 2 files to start from, which have the same name:
- x.stories.js: imports the twig, data and the doc file + creates your dummy component by combining twig and data
- x.mdx: your markdown documentation

And then there are the component files:<br />
- YML files: imported at the top of the document, the dummy data that is used by the twig templates
- twig files: imported at the top of the document. <br />
Will either be a styleguide twig file that acts as a wrapper (include or embed the 'real' twig files)<br />
or you can import 'real' twig files directly.

See the documentation for Atoms/00-example, Molecules/00-example and Organisms/00-example for more detailed info on what goes into those files.

## Add-ons

At the top of the content, you get a few tabs and some icons for extra functionality.

- tabs: switch between 'canvas' (rendering of the component) and 'doc' (the documentation for the component category)
- zoom icons: like a browser zoom
- color blindness emulation: changes the colors
- viewport: change the size of your preview, to emulate a fixed screen size (like a mobile phone)

A t the bottom of the content, you have some more things:
- Accessibility: every component is run through WCAG AA testing and outputs the result. The theme already does a lot of things right, so ideally the issues that pop up should be minimal and you should fix them.
- Actions: outputs console.log and errors you might get from your stories or loaded js libraries.
