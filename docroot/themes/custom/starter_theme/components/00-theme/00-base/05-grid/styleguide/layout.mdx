# Layout

## Vertical rhythm

In order to set up consistent vertical space (vertical rhythm) and horizontal<br />
spacing, the theme contains several variables in<br />
`00-theme/00-base/00-config/00-variables/_vars-01-layout.scss`<br />
You can tweak these if you need, but keep in mind they are part of a system<br />
used throughout the whole site to make your life easier. If you just need 1<br />
element to have a different amount of spacing (eg. the homepage blocks and<br />
rows), please just use another variable in those elements.

- `var(--gap-md)` is based on the line-height, because this will make space in<br />
texts (eg paragraphs and lists). Therefor, it is based on the typography<br />
sizing. It's the basis used in print design for ensuring readability and a<br />
nice vertical rhythm.
- `var(--gap-xs)` `var(--gap-sm)`: these are 2 smaller variants of this, used<br />
when less space is needed. Eg. with small titles or other smaller bits of text.<br />
The reason these have a fixed size, is because you can't set a minimum margin<br />
or padding size, so we had to settle for a fixed value instead. So you might<br />
need to tweak these a bit based on how big your line-height is.<br />
- `var(--gap-lg)`: The bigger gaps are still based on your typography

## Horizontal space

There is a default gap size defined, that is also the fallback for the grid<br />
system gaps between columns. Try to keep this value the same as in the designs.<br />
The container padding is half of the columns gap.

## Positioning layers

That layout variables file also contains a map of z-indexes `$z-index` you can use to<br />
keep overview of all the layers in your site. This is especially important<br />
for the mobile menu and other overlays.<br />
Use the mixin `@include z-index(myMapKey)` to set specific z-indeces.

!!!USE THE MIXIN AND THESE VARIABLES!!!

**Important!**

- Keep in mind that a z-index ONLY works on an element with a position<br />
(relative/absolute/fixed/â€¦).
- Remember that if you nest layers, their z-index is always RELATIVE to the<br />
closest wrapper with a position.
- For these reasons, the `.container` and several other wrappers do not have a<br />
default position: relative. We want to avoid having to override these in the<br />
header.
- Resetting positioning on an element can always be done by giving it<br />
`position: static`. This makes the element ignore position, z-index,<br />
left/right/top/bottom.

## Breakpoints

Breakpoints are set and used in 3 places:

- **in the theme (and dropsolid_core module)**<br />
`breakpoints.yml`-files:<br />
These are used for responsive image styles by Drupal
- **in the Sass**<br />
  `00-theme/00-base/02-helpers/02-mixins/_mixins-00-breakpoints.scss`<br />
  `00-theme/00-base/00-config/00-variables/_vars-breakpoints.scss`<br />
  You get a lot of possible breakpoints here but the most important thing to<br />
  remember, is that we work from the 'mobile first' principle.<br />
  **Meaning**: most breakpoints go from smaller to bigger screens using<br />
  'min-width'.<br />
  **However**, there are exceptions: we have breakpoints to add styling<br />
  specific for a certain breakpoint (eg. bp-xs-only is only small phones)<br />
  OR smaller than a max-width (eg. bp-sm-only is for screens smaller then or<br />
  equal to tablet).<br />
  **Why do we have those exceptions?** Because sometimes a mobile design is<br />
  very different from the bigger screens (eg. mobile menu and navigation) and<br />
  we don't want to have to undo a bunch of styling.

- **in the JS**<br />
  `00-base/06-scripts/00-helpers.js`<br />
  There is a `self.screen` variable set up so you can check on which breakpoint<br />
  you are. This is used by the JS that does the mobile menu navigation but can<br />
  come in handy in other places as well.<br />
  It relies on the getBreakpoint and checkScreensize functions, which refer to<br />
  a pseudo-element set by CSS.

## Grid system

`00-theme/00-base/05-grid`
We have a grid system in place that uses flexbox and has fallback stuff for IE.<br />
Inside this folder, you will find the mixins and examples using html.

You might also notice there is a `_alt` folder. This one contains a couple of<br />
experimental grid systems, using CSS Grid. Do not use this in production as<br />
long as IE is supported. The fallback system is complex and unstable.
