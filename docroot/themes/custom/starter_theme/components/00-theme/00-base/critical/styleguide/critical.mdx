# Critical CSS

Adding Critical CSS can cut down on loading times for your styling, especially on pages with complex designs. <br />
It should save you some points in Google Lighthouse and such because it shortens the time to first render.

What it is, is CSS that is loaded inline, in the head of specific urls of your site and is achieved in 2 parts.

## CSS file creation

There is a gulp task which will collect the CSS needed for 'above the fold' rendering on various breakpoints, based on 2 variables:
- the url
- a name to give to the file
The resulting CSS-file gets saved in your theme's `css/critical` folder. <br />
You should make at least 1 file for the homepage and 1 based on the basic page with a text and story paragraph. <br />
If you want to make more, start with extra files per type of page that has major theming differences above the fold, eg. detail page per content type.

`gulp css:critical --criticalUrl https://my-url.com/ --criticalName home`


## CSS loading

In order to load the CSS file(s) in the HEAD, per path, we have 2 solutions:
- Manual
- Using a module

### Manual

Add your CSS-files to `_html--master.twig`, right below the head-placeholder token:

```
{# Example: adding Critical CSS for frontpage + all the rest #}
{% if is_front %}
  <style>{{ source( base_path ~ directory ~ '/css/critical/home.css')|replace({'../fonts': base_path ~ directory ~ '/fonts'})|replace({'../images': base_path ~ directory ~ '/images'})|raw }}</style>
{% else %}
  <style>{{ source( base_path ~ directory ~ '/css/critical/default-critical.css')|replace({'../fonts': base_path ~ directory ~ '/fonts'})|replace({'../images': base_path ~ directory ~ '/images'})|raw }}</style>
{% endif %}

```

This example loads 1 file for the path of the frontpage (based on the boolean variable `is_front`, which has been created using a theme function ages ago), and a generic file for all the other paths. <br />
You can finetune this yourself to check more paths, by adding your own expression to the `HOOK_preprocess` function that checks specific paths and save that in a variable as well. <br />
Or check existing Drupal variables directly in the twig template (but it's a bit cleaner to put logic in the theme functions instead of in Twig)

*Note:* The critical CSS files will only work if all relative paths are replaced with absolute ones (as you can see has been done for `../fonts` ).

### Using the module

As an alternative, the 'critical_css' module (on drupal.org) lets you define a path to your CSS files and will attempt to load them based on the file name (read the module's info). <br />
Eg. the module will provide Twig naming suggestions if you have Twig debug enabled. The proposed name of a critical css file, is always based on the node name. For example, the front page needs `css/critical/front.css` or `css/critical/path-front.css`

However, I've encountered some breaking issues (eg. the admin theme switching to the front-end theme for no reason). I also have no idea if it reliably handles relative paths and fonts so you'll have to test it for yourself.
