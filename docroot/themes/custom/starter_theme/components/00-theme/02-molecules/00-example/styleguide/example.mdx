# Making a Molecule story component

We can expand on our Atoms example in order to build Molecules.

At the basic level, Molecules are groups of Atoms. <br />
So we build our Molecule components by starting with a Twig-file that can act as a wrapper (usually a block)<br />
and embed fields in it (the so called Atoms).<br />
To avoid having to do a lot of duplication of Twig and data, we can direclty import the styleguide Atoms we already created.

## Story file

### Working with data

As mentioned in the example component under `Atoms`, there are more ways to deal with data, especially when components get more complex.

In Molecules, it can be handy to have data for the overall block (eg. the label) but combine it with the yml files from existing atoms.<br />
So we would have multiple imports we need to combine. There are 3 ways to achieve this: <br />
- passing multiple data objects to your component
- appending one object to another
- deep merging the data objects

#### 1) Multiple data objects

If there are any overlapping structures in your 2 data files, the second file will override what is in the first.<br />
This is a handy way to combine a set of generic data and then add more specific stuff per component variant.<br />

Import:

```
import infoBlockData from './info-block.yml';
import infoBlockHomepageData from './info-block--homepage.yml';
```

Pass it to twig:

```
__html: exampleTwig({...infoBlockData, ...infoBlockHomepageData})

```

#### 2) Simple append (or override)

A bit more dirty, but if you simply need to append or override one key in your data object <br />
and don't want to add extra files to do so, you can modify the data object directly.<br />
A useful case, would be if you want to reuse data from an atom component, into your molecule (eg. image data).

Import and change:

```
import infoBlockData from './info-block.yml';
import imageData from '../../../01-atoms/images/styleguide/image.yml';

infoBlockData.fields.image = imageData;
```

Pass it to twig as you normally would:

```
__html: exampleTwig(infoBlockData)

```

#### 3) Merge data

Sometimes, your data is more complex and you need to merge nested data objects. One example is when dealing with drupalSettings.

We can add fake drupalSettings to a component by importing it from a yml file, just like any other data, <br />
but in order to make it available to our component JS-files, we need to merge it with the global `window.drupalSettings`<br />
In case there is already (nested) data inside drupalSettings, we want to merge our old with our new data.

```
// node module to enable deep merge
const merge = require('deepmerge');

// import data that contains a 'drupalSettings' key with data in it
import infoBlockSettings from './info-block-settings.yml';

// merge the global drupalSettings with our locally imported settings
// (nested values from first object will override values in second object)
infoBlockSettings.drupalSettings = merge(infoBlockSettings.drupalSettings || {}, drupalSettings || {});
// Important: make sure merged data is saved back in the global variable, for use with component JS files
drupalSettings = infoBlockSettings.drupalSettings

// now we can pass the infoBlockSettings to our twig components and it will contain the COMPLETE drupalSettings
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: exampleBlockTwig({...infoBlockSettings, ...infoBlockData}) }} />
```

Another situation, would be when you want to reuse data from Molecule components into Organisms.<br />
For example, this is how the menus and blocks are included in the header and footer Organisms.<br />


# Data structure

Here's an overview of the basic keys you need to render Molecules.<br />
But be aware that different Molecules could need different keys.

## For blocks

the entity's title (even if we'll hide it):
```
label: 'Example block'
```

Show or hide the title visually is set in 'configuration'
```
configuration:
  label_hidden: false
````

If the block title is hidden, you still need to provide the label + a heading_id<br />
This is because the title needs to be accessible (Drupal builds up that id automatically, Storybook does not)<br />
_Note: If you don't provide a heading_id, twig will try to make one up based on the BEM block and a timestamp._
```
heading_id: "block-example-xyz"
````

The block type is used to build out classes using a BEM structure. <br />
You can either pass it as-is in the `block_type` variable (string) <br />
or put it in the `bem_block_modifiers` variable (array) (more on BEM further below)
```
block_type: content
```
```
bem_block_modifiers:
 - type-content
```

**Modifiers**, so we get proper BEM classes to style:<br />

- **Block type:** will produce the most important class you will need to style a block. <br />
Unless it is the block type 'content'. This one is too generic to style by block type class.<br />
If you don't fill it in here, the block twig will attempt to get the type from the `block_type` variable instead.
- **Unique id of the node:** (optional) Normally comes from `plugin_id` in Drupal. <br />
Try to avoid styling blocks by plugin id class name when possible.<br />
The exception, is when the generic block type 'content' was used to set a block (eg. on the homepage),<br />
in which case you don't have much choice but to use the plugin id class.<br />
In the normal Drupal blocks, this is pushed to `attributes['data-bem']`, via a theme function<br />
- **Region:** (optional) can be handy to style a block in context of its Organism. <br />
In Drupal blocks, this is also built up in a theme function and passed to `attributes['data-bem']`.
- **View-mode**: (optional) could be handy for theming by context, if you use different view-modes for a block in different places<br />
eg. if a social block in the header uses a simplified view-mode (eg. no labels) but the full one in the doormat.<br />
But that is exceptional.
- **Provider:** (optional) tells you what gave you the block (eg. layout-builder, system, block_content).<br />
Not much use for styling

```
bem_block_modifiers:
  - type-content
  - block-content78dd02b1-c1e2-4a8a-bc31-f4b8ad7672f3
  - region-doormat
  - view-mode-full
  - provider-layout-builder
```

```
classes output:
block block--type-content block--region-doormat block--provider-layout-builder block--block-content78dd02b1-c1e2-4a8a-bc31-f4b8ad7672f3 block--view-mode-full
```

**Extra classes**: <br />

Not that useful for styling unless nested context is important, but then you probably have better classes on the various nested wrappers.<br />
Eg. the provider pops up here again (via configuration.provider), prefixed with 'block-' (eg. block-layout-builder, block-block_content, block-system, â€¦)

```
bem_block_extra:
 - 'block-block_content'
```

### Block title

As mentioned, heading can be visible or hidden. If hidden, the title content is automatically printed as `aria-label` on the block (for accessibility) and no heading is printed in the html.<br />
If visible, the title is printed (h2 by default or h4 in footer and doormat blocks) and `aria-labelledby` is printed on the block, containing the `heading_id`

In Storybook components, you might get an accessibility error for duplicate id's on a block or block field.<br />
This can happen when you have a field label that is visible, and it inherits the block's `heading_id`<br />
If you encounter that warning, see to it that your block's `heading_id` is different from the `label_id` of your field.


### Block fields
