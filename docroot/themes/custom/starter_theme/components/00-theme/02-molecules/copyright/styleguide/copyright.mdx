Used in the footer Organism. <br />
This block is produced by Rocketship Core, so changes to labels or functionality should be made in that module via a patch.

There are 2 optional links you can fill in (Terms and Privacy), in the block configuration (via block layout in Drupal) <br />
but if these are not enough for your project, it is best to simply leave them empty, and add a separate menu in the footer instead.
