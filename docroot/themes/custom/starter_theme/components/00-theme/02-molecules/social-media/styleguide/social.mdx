# Social media

We have 2 forms of social media icons display:
- a custom block type to link to the client's various social media profiles, used in the doormat (or other places)
- a 'widget' (a block produced by the Drupal module `rocketship_social_widgets`) that produces share-links, which post url of the node it is on, to various platforms (or prints the node)

So both are very different in functionality.
