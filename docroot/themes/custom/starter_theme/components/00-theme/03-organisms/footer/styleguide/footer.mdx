## Doormat

The doormat structure can be customized to have as many columns as you want (by default, the Flex theme has 4, the Minimal and Starter begin with 1). <br />
Add more (or remove some) as needed by the design, you can add individual column classes to control the individual width<br />
(so they don't HAVE to all be the same width if not designed that way)

Usually those columns will contain some menus (eg. new sitemap menu or reuse main menu 1st level), <br />
a branding block, social media block and contact info block.

A contact block used to be provided by the Office Feature <br />
(and lives as an example Molecule component under `components/00-examples/02-features/f006-office/02-molecules/f006-office-contact`) <br />
You could make a custom block type under the normal Molecules to mimic this.

## Primary footer

Usually only has 2 blocks: the copyright and the 'powered by' blocks.<br />
An example is included (see footer--primary.twig and the story file) for adding an extra menu.<br />
As explained in the copyright component doc, you may need the extra menu if you have more links to add than simpoy the T&C + Privacy Policy.
