# Features

In previous iterations of Rocketship, we had modules that preinstalled Content Types such as Blog, News, Events, â€¦ <br />
Since the Layout Builder based version of Rocketship doesn't support this, we have moved the relevant Sass and JS files for such components, into `components/02-features/00-examples`.  <br />
The files you find in there might still be useful when starting to theme brand new Content Types yourself.
They demonstrate how you could split off more theming into separately loaded components and they are usefull as theming snippets.

When you want to do your own theming for a Content type, you are still free to add your files to `components/00-theme` but you also have the option to put it into `02-features` instead. <br />

### Keep in mind:
- Any Sass and JS files in folders of `02-features` will be picked up by Gulp automatically **ONLY** if you include your own component scss file in the root folder of your Feature, which combines all the partial scss files (see any of the Feature examples)
- You still have to make a theme library and include it in your theme (eg. in the info file, via a theme hook or in a twig template). These are separate components after all.
