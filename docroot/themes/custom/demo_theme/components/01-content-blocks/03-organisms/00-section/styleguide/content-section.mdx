# Content sections

Layout templates, specifically made for Rocketship, can be applied on Sections to create rows that have or don't have columns, as well as other special options. <br />
By adding Content Blocks to the regions inside those Sections (in columns or not), we effectively create Content Sections. <br />
Working this way, the combinations of Blocks and Sections are equivalent to working with the Paragraph types in Rocketship before the switch to Layout Builder.
In these following components, we explore the various combinations of the Content Blocks and different column structures the Sections offer, as well as various other variants created by extra options.

## Layouts

So far, we have these:
- 1-col: just 1 column, has a main region and 2 subregions you can enable to group fields together above or below the main region
- 2-col: 2 colums, each column has 1 regions (but the Webadmin only has 1 region per column available)
- 3-col: 3 colums, only for use with USP block type
- 4-col: 4 columns, only for use with USP block type
- carousel: has 1 main section that uses Slick to create a carousel from all the blocks inside of it. We only allow Image blocks to be used, by the webadmin. Equivalent to the Logo Bar Paragraph type.

## Section options

The various sections have options that can be used to differentiate them from each other, depending on what Layout was chosen. <br />
Some options are hidden from content editors (eg. Webadmin) and only for developers (superadmin).<br />
Here is an overview of the most common options.

### Minimal styling

Only for developers.

If turned off, many classes and styles will be reset. This is so you can still use Rocketship layouts on Sections to build custom rows with custom block types.<br />
This needs to be turned on if used in combination with Content Blocks.

How it's used in the data of the Storybook components:

```
minimal_styling: false
```

### Extra classes and BEM

Developers have the option to add strings that will be converted to extra classes on the Section. This can be used to customize a Section or Blocks inside those sections and create variants.

```
modifier: my-modifier
extra_classes: 'test01 test02 test03' # use spaces to separate multiple class names
```

### Padding

Top and bottom padding can be modified. <br />
This is handy if you have 2 sections with the same background-color following each other. <br />
By resetting the bottom space of the first Section, you can prevent it from looking like there is too much space between the Sections.<br />

Data:
```
section_spacing_top: 1x
section_spacing_bottom: 0x
```

Outputs as classes:
```
layout--v-space-top-1x layout--v-space-bottom-0x
```

### Background-color and background-image

All Rocketship Layouts have this option.<br />
Outputs a preview of the colors defined in: /admin/config/system/rocketship-core

This option allows you to pick a background-color (coming from configuration), which is output as multiple classes.<br />

The data you use in a Storybook component, is simplified somewhat in order to make it easier:

```
background_color: spot_1 # the machine name for the color
background_image: true # if true, outputs a random image from a generator
```

The output as classes on the layout html:

```
layout--bg-color: generic, when a bg color is active
layout--bg--spot-1: for the specific color
layout--bg-image: if a bg image is active
```

### Other

We won't reitterate all the available options, as they can be seen and tested in the section components themselves, but here is an overview of most of the others:<br />

- column sizes (2-col only)
- column spacing
  - can choose which one to override + the size of the spacing
- vertial alignment of the columns (multi-column layouts only)
- subregions (1-col only, available for developers)
  - subregion 1 (displays above the main region)
  - subregion 2 (displays below the main region)
- autoplay (carousel layout only)


## Structure

The html is coming from a combination of the generic Layout Builder html, with html coming from the specific layout templates. <br />
For use in components, we've faked the layouts in `00-theme/04-templates/styleguide`. These are copies of what is made available by the Rocketship Core module.

## Data structure

Besides the options being separate keys in the data, that result in classes on the html, there are some other typical bits of data:

The label as well as the name of the template (which is also output as a class)
```
label: 'Content'
template: 'rs-two-col'
```

The regions inside of the Section need to be enabled in the data of components.<br />
The name depends on which Layout Template is in use:

Example for Rocketship 1 col:
```
content:
  content: true
  before01: false
  before02: false
  after01: false
  after02: false
````

Example for Rocketship 2 col:

```
content:
  first_main: true
  second_main: true
```

## Structural CSS and colors

As mentioned, when Rocketship Core module is enabled, you have access to a configuration screen to add your background colors.<br />
However, there are a few more options to note:

- **Enable structural CSS:** if you are not using a Rocketship theme, enabling this option loads some css to at least get some basic styling. <br />
   For reference, the file used, is `style.content-blocks.colors.min.css` in RS Core module. This CSS is created by taking a Starter theme, and then compiling the Sass. <br />
   The resulting CSS can be found in `css/style.content-blocks.colors.css`.<br />
   You do need to remove some styling at the very start of the file, before it can be used. Namely the `.icon--…` and `body::after` stuff.
- **Enable Colors CSS:** enabling this option loads extra CSS for extra color variants, if you don't use a Rocketship theme. <br />
   For reference, a CSS-template `style.content-blocks.layout.min.css` is used to generate exact CSS. It is created by a Starter theme when compiling the Sass to CSS.<br />
   The resulting CSS can be found in `css/style.content-blocks.structural.css`.<br />
   You do need to remove some styling at the very start of the file, before it can be used. Namely the `.icon--…` and `body::after` stuff.
