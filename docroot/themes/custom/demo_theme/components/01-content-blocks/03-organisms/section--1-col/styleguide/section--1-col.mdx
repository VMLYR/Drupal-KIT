## Backgrounds

In order to add a background image, you need to pass 2 keys to your layout data:

```
layout_background: true # allows it to set an image
layout_background_image: # this should contain an object with the image data you want to use (starts with the key `reference`)
```

For examples, refer to the twig and yml files in this Styleguide folder:
- background-image.yml: contains the correct data structure
