# Pages

Pages are constructed using a couple of nested templates:
- the `_page--master.twig` template, which renders the correct page wrappers and prints the stuff around the page content (eg. header and footer)
- the `_block.twig` template (from Molecules), to display a system block
- the `_node.twig` template (from Organisma), to display the content of the 'basic page' node, in 'full' view mode <br />

The page master template holds the regions to load all the menus and blocks that you find in Drupal's Block Layout.

## Structure

### block

For data structure, see 00-Example in the Molecules.

We don't do anything with this block, it's just a wrapper from Drupal.<br />
So we don't bother including the block template and just dump the div directly.

### Node

For data structure, see 00-Example in the Organisms.

It's always going to be a 'full' view mode with pages.
