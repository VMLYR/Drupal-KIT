# Header

The header is a very complex Organism, with several nested Organsism, menu's and blocks. <br />
Especially because the mobile navigation can include different elements than<br />
the bigger menu and certain blocks need to be displayed in different places<br />
depending on the breakpoint.

**Add your blocks and menu's to the right regions:**

- **header_top**: blocks and stuff that goes in a bar above the primary header & logo.<br />
Eg. language switcher, contact info or social media icons<br />
- **top navigation**: menu's that are in the header top (so above the primaryheader)
- **primary header**: usually only the logo (branding block) is in here. <br />
Unless you need some blocks besides whatever is in the navigation.
- **nav primary and nav secondary**: these 2 regions are used to build the 2
possible navigations that go next to or under the logo in the header. <br />
Those 2 are grouped into the 'nav' (twig files) and 'mobile navigation' (concept).<br />
So anything in those regions is visible in the open mobile menu. <br />
Eg. the primary and main menu's + any CTA blocks next to it. <br />
Also social media icons that are visible on mobile but not desktop.

As you can read, we have some specialized groupings in place for building the<br />
elements of the header and navigation. Of course these all need to be styled<br />
in the right place as well.

**Be careful to add your styling to the right files:**

- styling the search block: molecules/search/search-block
- styling the other blocks: molecules/whateverblock
- styling the menu's that go inside the navigation: molecules/menus/menu
- styling the header logo: molecules/branding
- positioning the elements of the navigation (menu's + blocks):
organisms/header/nav
- positioning the elements in the header (logo + several wrappers):
organisms/header/header--primary

As mentioned in the `breakpoints` documentation, the navigation uses breakpoints<br />
in order to make a mobile navigation and a bigger navigation.
We also use several block layout regions to group elements from the header <br />
and navigations in a way that works for mobile as well as wider screens


## data

You will see in the yml files, that we have imported yml files of molecules in order to recycle data.<br />
This is done by importing from a relative path + merging data from molecules into data from organisms.<br />
Information about 'deep merging' can be found in the Molecules Example documentation as well.

## navigation

### navigation sections

By default, the navigation shows 2 nav sections (primary nav + secondary nav) containing the 'main menu'<br />
 + 'language menu' (visible on desktop only).<br />
But if you have extra navigations (or blocks), to render on mobile or desktop (or both),<br />
simply add your menus/blocks to the correct section (most likely the secondary nav) via:
- block layout in Drupal
- and in the styleguide/nav.twig file.

All you then need, is a twig embed + yml data for those elements.

As examples, in the styleguide/nav twig file, there is already code and data included for:
- a secondary menu, in the secondary nav

The reason the secondary menu does not display in Storybook, <br />
is because it is commented out, so turn it on if you need it or replace with another twig.

### language menu

This menu is special because it is added in the header twice, in order to show it in 2 different places depending on the your screen size.<br />
This is achieved by showing/hiding the correct menu in CSS:
- nav.twig: visible on desktop (it is rendered in the secondary navigation region)
- header--top.twig: visible on mobile (it is rendered in the top header)
