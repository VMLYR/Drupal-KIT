# Visual

Show a big visual on the homepage, as is present in homepage demo content.

An alternative for this block COULD be to use the 'Image' Content Block, with a 1-col Rocketship layout.<br />
But if you don't want to be bound to that Block type's image style and might need to override some default styling you have no time for, you're better off making a custom block like this.

In short:
- making a new custom block with the field(s) you need
- make a new responsive image style, named after your block
- and turning on 'Minimal styling' on the Layout
