# Text

## Styling
Basically all manner of inline and block tags can be seen and styled here.<br />
Mixins from `_text-helpers.scss` are used to style chuncks, which are set up in `_text.scss`.

Pay special attention to the `text-long` mixin, which produces the styling for text coming from CKEditor.<br />
This is the styling that is shown in the Storybook components (text wrapper has the `text-long` class).
