# Headings

There are helpers in the `_headings-helpers.scss` file to help you style headings.

The styling is applied in `_headings.scss`<br />
You will see you can style default heading tags, as well as headings in CKEditor and classes that emulate a heading style (eg. .h2)

Pay special attention to the `text-long` styling because that is what comes out of CKEditor.

## tag vs Field

The heading atom is not used by Drupal directly, but is included inside other components, replacing Drupal's normal rendering of titles<br />
eg. a block heading, field label, â€¦ <br />

In Drupal sitebuilding, there is also a field formatter that turns a normal text field into a heading tag. <br />
Fields set up by those formatters render their content using this heading atom.

If you want to render a heading field, that looks like what Drupal produces, inside a Storybook Molecule, <br />
you can include `heading-field.twig`. This wraps the hx-tag inside the correct field wrappers and classes as output by Drupal.<br />
Examples of this can be found in the 'example' Molecule.
