## Blocks

### Overview page
Has a new overview for Content Blocks, accessible by webadmins. It's a View, 
so change away after installation. This one is placed at admin/content. 
There's also a redirect from the original library at admin/structure because 
that one is still the normal redirect after an edit or translate action. The 
original path is a lot harder to tweak, as it is both a route (backup) and a 
View, and altering both seems a bit much but we may do that in the future.
