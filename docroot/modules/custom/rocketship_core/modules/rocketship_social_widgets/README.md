# Rocketship Social Widgets 

This module provides sharing links available as an extra display field attached to node, or a custom block. 

By default it provides links for these social media platforms: 
* Facebook 
* Twitter

And ability to configure more services via custom administration form.

Configuration: /admin/config/services/social-share

## TODO

* Make the enabled links for extra fields configurable by extending the third party settings.
* Refactor the onclick property to something more abstract
