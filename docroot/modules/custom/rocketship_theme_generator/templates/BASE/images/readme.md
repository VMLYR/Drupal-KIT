## Image optimization

Images placed in `source` will be optimized when gulp task `images` is run.
The optimized images end up in `generated`.

So make sure you put your **original images in 'source'**
and only **reference the 'generated' images** when using images in CSS or HTML

This task runs automatically when `prod` tasks runs.
