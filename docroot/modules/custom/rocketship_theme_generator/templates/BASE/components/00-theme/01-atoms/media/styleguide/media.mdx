# Media reference field

## Data structure

```
media_bundle: the type of media (eg. video)
media_published: if it's published or not
view_mode: the view_mode
```

`media_bundle` and `media_published` are abstractions of the data in Drupal, which comes from nested elements inside the `media` object:
- `media.isPublished()`
- `media.bundle()`

The reason for the abstraction, is that TwigJS can't handle these functions by default.
