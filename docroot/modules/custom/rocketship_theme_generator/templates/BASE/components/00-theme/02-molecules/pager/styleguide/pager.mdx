# Pager

## Full

Besides the page numbers, it includes links to go to first/last and prev/next pages<br />
Some changes to these links (like the text) can be made in individual view settings, but the arrows are overridden by icons using Sass.<br />
Best to leave the view settings as-is.

## Mini

Limited to prev and next page navigation
