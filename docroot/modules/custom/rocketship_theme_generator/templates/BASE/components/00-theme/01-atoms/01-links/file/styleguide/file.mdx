# File

Various types of files exist in Drupal, these components only emulate a couple of them: image, pdf and generic file.<br />
If you need any more, simply copy/paste existing yml files and change the data and name to match your new file type.<br />
Don't forget to import the new data and add a new component export in the story file.

Styling of the icons relies on FontAwesome. If you use a custom icon font, you will have to add your new icons in `_link-file.scss`
