/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to display a formatted blazy image/media field.
 *
 * The Blazy supports core image, responsive image and media entity.
 * If iframe switcher is enabled, audio/video iframe will be hidden below image
 * overlay, and only visible when toggled. Otherwise iframe only, and image is
 * emptied.
 *
 * Available variables:
 *   - captions: An optional renderable array of inline or lightbox captions.
 *   - image: A collection of image data.
 *   - attributes: An array of attributes applied to .media container.
 *   - iframe: A renderable array of iframe with its attributes and SRC.
 *   - settings: An array containing the given settings.
 *   - url: An optional URL the image can be linked to, can be any of
 *       audio/video, or entity URLs, when using Colorbox/Photobox, or Link to
 *       content options.
 *   - url_attributes: An array of URL attributes, lightbox or content links.
 *   - noscript: The fallback image for non-js users.
 *   - postscript: Any extra content to put into blazy goes here. Use keyed or
 *       indexed array to not conflict with or nullify other providers, e.g.:
 *       postscript.cta, or postscript.widget. Avoid postscript = cta.
 *   - content: Various Media entities like Facebook, Instagram, local Video,
 *       etc. Basically content is the replacement for (Responsive) image
 *       and oEmbed video. This makes it possible to have a mix of Media
 *       entities, image and videos on a Blazy Grid, Slick, GridStack, etc.
 *       Regular Blazy features are still disabled by default at
 *       \Drupal\blazy\BlazyDefault::richSettings() to avoid complication.
 *       However you can override them accordingly as needed, such as lightbox
 *       for local Video with/o a pre-configured poster image. The #settings
 *       are provided under content variables for more work. Originally
 *       content is a theme_field() output, trimmed down to bare minimum.
