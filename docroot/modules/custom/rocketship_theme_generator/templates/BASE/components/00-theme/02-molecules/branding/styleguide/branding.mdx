# Branding

You will see 2 kinds of branding Molecules here:
- a default Drupal block type (set by the system) which produces the logo (and slogan) that goes in the header
- a custom block type that can be used to print the logo and some text any other place in the site (usually next to the doormat navigation)

## Site logo

Will be referred to in this styleguide as 'site branding' or 'system branding'
Prints a logo, with the site name and (optionally) the slogan

## Branding block

A custom block.

### The yml data:

#### For the block

the entity's title (even if we'll hide it):
```
label: 'About us'
```

hide the title visually
```
configuration:
  label_hidden: true
````

The important modifiers (for BEM class construction) are:
- the block type, so we can do some generic theming
- the region, so we can theme it in context of the doormat if needed

```
bem_block_modifiers:
  - type-site-branding
  - region-doormat
```

#### For the fields

Some useful extra classes, for the image field, because we use Blazy:

```
- bem_field_extra:
  - 'blazy'
  - 'blazy--field'
  - 'blazy--field-media-info-image'
```
